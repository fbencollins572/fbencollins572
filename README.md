- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ben Collins. I am currently working as a full time Software Developer, specializing in Java. 
     But I also have experience in Javascript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Vue.js, some basic PHP, SQL, PHPMyAdmin and Leaflet.js.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in going to the gym and keeping healthy, I also love playing online games such as Call of Duty and Counter Strike. I am also a Sims lover.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Vue and doing a Web Development Bootcamp. It is just to improve my skills and get a better look on how different things are done.
-    I am looking to improve myself and become the best Developer I can be. I think I still need to learn millions of more stuff, as I have only 3 years experience.
